  <p>This Example shows you how to use Winsock Control in your applications. How 
    connections are made how the data transfer occurs. How do our application 
    operates when specific data is received all the things are shown in this example. 
    You can use this on your network and even on Internet to play with your friends. 
    The Standalone media player also works fine but if you want to control it 
    remotely then Use the remote control and connect to his PC by giving the IP 
    of his Computer. That way you will be able to control the Media-Player. If 
    you want to test this code on your standalone PC then let the IP be &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; 
    don't change it. You can even specify the name of your computer in that Text-Box 
    it will also work. If you think you understood all this through this example 
    then try different things. E.g.: put a button on remote to hide the media-player. 
    You can also minimize and maximize or even close the media-player through 
    remote. If you didn't understood something in this then Please read the Winsock 
    Tutorial on PSC. You can go there by <a href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=48418&lngWId=1">Clicking
